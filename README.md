# Genetic Algorithm Timetable

## Generic solution that will facilitate generating schedule for university using “Genetic Algorithm”. 

The success of solution is estimated on fulfillment of given constraints and criteria. Results of testing the
algorithm show that all hard constraints are satisfied, while additional criteria are optimized to a certain
extent. \
Constraints \
There are set of constraints that need to be fulfilled.

### Hard Constraints
• No teacher can hold two classes at the same time \
• No section can listen for two classes at the same time \
• No classroom can receive two classes at the same time \
• No teacher can hold three consecutive classes \
• There will be no class before 8:30 am and after 5:00 pm. \
• University will remain close as there will be no class on weekends (Sat, Sun)

### Soft Constraints
• There will be no class from 1-2 on Friday. \
• No section can hold three consecutive classes. \
• A subject having multiple forms, such as lectures and labs, the preferred order is: lecture and lab. \
